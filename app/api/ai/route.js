Based on the user's specific request above (but if user's request doesn't have anything specific then only suggest your own ideas), analyze these videos to create a reel that fulfills their vision while incorporating current social media best practices.

PRIORITIZE USER'S REQUEST FIRST, then enhance with these trending elements where appropriate:

CURRENT TRENDING AESTHETICS  TO CONSIDER:
- Soft life / slow living content
- Golden hour / warm lighting
- Film grain and vintage filters  
- Minimal text overlays with aesthetic fonts
- Smooth transitions (only when explicitly requested)
- Color grading towards warm, muted tones
- Quick cuts synchronized with music beats
- Morning/evening routine content
- "Get ready with me" style
- Cozy, hygge vibes
- Clean girl aesthetic
- Cottagecore elements

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Duration: 15-30 seconds for optimal engagement
2. Format: 9:16 aspect ratio (1080x1920) vertical
3. Hook: Make first 3 seconds compelling
4. Pacing: Match the energy requested by user
5. Composition: Use rule of thirds
6. Stabilization: Apply to shaky footage
7. Audio: Suggest music that matches user's desired vibe

ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION:
- Start with most captivating moment in first 2 seconds
- Use jump cuts to maintain energy
- Include trending audio/music suggestions
- Add subtle motion graphics or overlays
- Ensure good pacing - not too slow or fast
- Include captions for accessibility
- Suggest hashtag-worthy moments

CONTENT ADAPTATION BASED ON USER PROMPT:
- If user wants "energetic": Use quick cuts, upbeat transitions (if requested), higher saturation
- If user wants "calm/peaceful": Use slower pacing, soft transitions (if requested), muted colors  
- If user wants "professional": Clean cuts, minimal effects, clear text
- If user wants "trendy/viral": Apply current TikTok/Instagram trends heavily
- If user wants "cinematic": Use color grading, smooth transitions (if requested), dramatic timing
- If user wants specific mood/theme: Adapt all elements to match that vision

üö® CRITICAL RULES - THESE MUST BE STRICTLY FOLLOWED:

CLIP USAGE RULES:
- Each video clip (video1, video2, video3, etc.) can ONLY be used ONCE in the entire timeline
- NEVER repeat any clip to fill time UNLESS user explicitly requests repeating clips
- ONLY repeat clips if user specifically says "repeat" or "use again" in their prompt
- Choose the BEST ORDER of clips that suits the desired vibe/aesthetic, not necessarily video1‚Üívideo2‚Üívideo3
- Analyze all clips and arrange them in the most engaging sequence for the reel's mood

TRANSITION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):  
- DEFAULT: Set ALL transitions to "none" with duration 0.0
- ONLY add actual transitions if the user EXPLICITLY requests them in their prompt
- When user doesn't mention transitions: ALL transition types = "none", ALL durations = 0.0
- When transitions are "none": startTime and endTime of transition must equal the clip's start/end time

TRANSITION TIMING & DURATION RULES:
- When transitions ARE added (only if explicitly requested):
  - Transition duration MUST be included in the overall reel duration calculation
  - metadata.duration = sum of all clip durations + sum of all transition durations
  - Adjust clip durations to accommodate transition time within total 15-30 second limit
  - "in" transitions: start at clip's startTime, end at (startTime + transition_duration)
  - "out" transitions: start at (clip's endTime - transition_duration), end at clip's endTime
- When transitions are "none": no additional time added to metadata.duration

TIMING CALCULATION RULES:
- Each clip's startTime must exactly match the previous clip's endTime
- Each clip's endTime = startTime + duration  
- Final clip's endTime MUST equal metadata.duration exactly
- Total reel duration: 15-30 seconds maximum (including any transition time)
- If transitions are added: reduce clip durations proportionally to fit within total time limit
- Assign durations thoughtfully based on content engagement, NOT randomly

CLIP ORDERING STRATEGY:
- Analyze each clip's content, mood, and visual appeal
- Choose the most engaging clip as the hook (first 3-5 seconds)
- Arrange remaining clips to create the best flow for the desired vibe
- Consider: lighting, energy level, visual composition, story progression
- Create a sequence that builds engagement and matches the aesthetic goal

IMPORTANT: Do not just place clips sequentially without thought. Instead:
- The first 2-3 seconds must be a hook to grab viewers immediately
- Adjust the duration of each clip to match current social media reel trends and pacing
- Use transitions thoughtfully to enhance visual flow (only when explicitly requested)
- Place text overlays only where they enhance engagement, synced with the clip's mood
- Apply color grading, filters, and effects consistently across the reel to create a coherent aesthetic
- Structure the reel like a mini-story: hook ‚Üí content ‚Üí climax ‚Üí ending
- Ensure the reel feels dynamic, cohesive, and engaging rather than random
- Prioritize clips and timing according to engagement psychology, trending aesthetics, and the user's intent

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return a JSON object ensuring:
- Interpret user's intent and creative vision
- Create editing plan that achieves their specific goal
- All timing values as precise decimals
- Realistic parameter ranges (-100 to +100 for color grading)
- Use actual video editing terminology
- Suggest appropriate music genre for the user's request
- Include text overlays only if user wants them or they enhance the concept
- Font names are real, commonly available fonts
- Effects and filters are industry-standard names
- Audio suggestions match current trends

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no explanations, no markdown, no backticks
- Return raw JSON object without any formatting or text wrapper

FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:
‚ùå Using any video clip more than once (unless user explicitly requests repetition)
‚ùå Adding transitions when user didn't explicitly request them
‚ùå Random duration assignment without considering content
‚ùå Always using clips in video1‚Üívideo2‚Üívideo3 order without considering best flow
‚ùå Exceeding 30 seconds total duration (clips + transitions combined)
‚ùå Timing gaps or overlaps between clips
‚ùå Including explanatory text in JSON output
‚ùå Transition inputRange that is not strictly increasing (never [0,0])
‚ùå Transition startTime/endTime outside the clip's range

Make this reel achieve exactly what the user requested while being optimized for social media engagement.
